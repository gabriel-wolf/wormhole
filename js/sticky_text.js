Text[1] = ["Abiogenesis", "The study of how life on Earth could have arisen from inanimate matter. It should not be confused with evolution (the study of how living things change over time), biogenesis (the process of lifeforms producing other lifeforms) or spontaneous generation (the obsolete theory of complex life originating from inanimate matter on an everyday basis)."]
Text[2] = ["Absolute Zero", "The lowest temperature possible, equivalent to -273.15°C (or 0° on the absolute Kelvin scale), at which point atoms cease to move altogether and molecular energy is minimal. The idea that it is impossible, through any physical process, to lower the temperature of a system to zero is known as the Third Law of Thermodynamics."]
Text[108] = ["Accretion Disk", "Diffuse material orbiting around a central body such as a protostar, a young star, a neutron star or a black hole. Gravity causes the material in the disc to spiral inwards towards the central body with great speed, and the gravitational forces acting on the material cause the emission of x-rays, radio waves or other electromagnetic radiation (known as quasars)."]
Text[3] = ["Alpha Particle (Alpha Decay)", "A particle of 2 protons and 2 neutrons (essentially a helium nucleus) that is emitted by an unstable radioactive nucleus during radioactive decay. It is a relatively low-penetration particle due its comparatively low energy and high mass."]
Text[123] = ["Angular Momentum", "A measure of the momentum of a body in rotational motion about its center of mass. Technically, the angular momentum of a body is equal to the mass of the body multiplied by the cross product of the position vector of the particle with its velocity vector. The angular momentum of a system is the sum of the angular momenta of its constituent particles, and this total is conserved unless acted on by an outside force."]
Text[4] = ["Anthropic Principle", "The idea that the fundamental constants of physics and chemistry are just right (or 'fine-tuned') to allow the universe and life at we know it to exist, and indeed that the universe is only as it is because we are here to observe it. Thus, we find ourselves in the kind of universe, and on the kind of planet, where conditions are ripe for our form of life."]
Text[5] = ["Antimatter", "A large accumulation of antiparticles - antiprotons, antineutrons and positrons (antielectrons) - which have opposite properties to normal particles (e.g. electrical charge), and which can come together to make anti-atoms. When matter and antimatter meet, they self-destruct in a burst of high-energy photons or gamma rays.<BR>The laws of physics seem to predict a pretty much 50/50 mix of matter and antimatter, despite the observable universe apparently consisting almost entirely of matter, known as the 'baryon asymmetry problem'."]
Text[6] = ["Atom", "The basic building block of all normal matter, consisting of a nucleus (which is itself composed of positively-charged protons and zero-charged neutrons) orbited by a cloud of negatively-charged electrons, so that the positive charge is exactly balanced by the negative charge and the atom as a whole is electrically neutral. Atoms range from about 32 to about 225 picometers in size (a picometer is a trillionth of a meter). A typical human hair is about 1 million carbon atoms in width."]
Text[7] = ["Beta Particles (Beta Decay)", "High-energy, high-speed electrons or positrons (antielectrons) emitted by some types of radioactive decay, when an unstable atomic nucleus with an excess of neutrons or protons undergoes beta decay (a process mediated by the weak nuclear force). The particles emitted are a form of ionizing radiation, also known as beta rays."]
Text[8] = ["Big Bang", "The huge 'explosion' 13.7 billion years ago in which the universe (including all space, time and energy) is thought to have been created. According to this theory, the universe began in a super-dense, super-hot state and has been expanding and cooling ever since. The phrase was coined by Fred Hoyle during a 1949 radio broadcast."]
Text[9] = ["Big Crunch", "One possible scenario for the ultimate fate of the universe, in which the gravity of the matter in the universe (providing that there is in fact a 'critical mass') will one day halt and reverse the universe’s expansion in a mirror image of the Big Bang, causing it to collapse into a black hole singularity."]
Text[128] = ["Black Body", "An idealized object that absorbs all electromagnetic radiation that falls on it, without passing through and without reflection. The radiation emitted from a black body is mostly infrared light at room temperature, but as the temperature increases it starts to emit visible wavelengths, from red through to blue, and then ultraviolet light at very high temperatures."]
Text[10] = ["Black Hole", "The warped space-time remaining after the gravity of a massive body has caused it to shrink down to a point. It is a region of empty space with a point-like singularity at the center and an event horizon at the outer edge.<BR>A black hole is so dense that no normal matter or radiation can escape its gravitational field, so that nothing - not even light - can ever leave (hence its blackness). It is thought that most galaxies have a supermassive black hole at their heart."]
Text[116] = ["Classical Physics", "A general term used to describe the physics based on principles developed before the rise of general relativity and quantum mechanics, essentially physics as it had existed up to the early years of the 20th Century. It includes the mechanics of Galileo and Newton, the electrodynamics of Maxwell, the thermodynamics of Boyle and Kelvin, and usually even the special relativity of Einstein."]
Text[11] = ["Complementarity", "The idea in quantum theory that items can be separately analyzed as having several contradictory, and apparently mutually exclusive, properties. For example, the wave-particle duality of light, where light can either behave as a particle or as wave, but not simultaneously as both."]
Text[12] = ["Copernican Principle", "The idea that there is nothing special about our position in the universe, a generalized version of Nicolaus Copernicus’ recognition that the Earth is actually just a planet circling the Sun, and not vice versa."]
Text[43] = ["Cosmic Inflation", "The idea that, in the first split-second after the Big Bang, the universe underwent a fantastically fast (exponential) expansion driven by the vacuum of empty space. The theory was developed by Alan Guth in the early 1980s to explain certain problems and inconsistencies with the basic Big Bang theory, such as those related to the large-scale structure of the features of the universe, the 'horizon problem', the 'flatness problem' and the 'magnetic monopole problem'."]
Text[13] = ["Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation", "Cosmic microwave background radiation (or CMB for short) is the 'afterglow' of the Big Bang, a microwave radiation which still uniformly permeates all of space at a temperature of around -270°C. It is considered to be the best evidence for the Big Bang model of the universe."]
Text[14] = ["Cosmic Rays", "High speed, energetic particles (about 90% of which are protons) originating from space that impinge on Earth's atmosphere. Some are generated by our own Sun, some by supernovas, some by as yet unknown events in the farthest reaches of the visible universe. The term 'ray' is actually a misnomer, as cosmic particles arrive individually, not in the form of a ray or beam of particles."]
Text[15] = ["Cosmological Constant", "A term added by Albert Einstein as a modification to his original theory of general relativity, in order to balance the attractive force of gravity and achieve a static or stationary universe. It represents the possibility that there is a density and pressure associated with apparently empty space, and that the overall mass-energy of the universe is actually much greater than currently estimated.<BR>Once dismissed as just a mathematical 'fix', it has been revived in recent years with the discovery of the apparent acceleration of the expansion of the universe."]
Text[16] = ["Cosmological Principle", "The starting point for the General Theory of Relativity and the Big Bang theory is that that, averaged over large distances, one part of the universe looks approximately like any other part, and that, viewed on sufficiently large distance scales, there are no preferred directions or preferred places in the universe. Stated in more technical terms, on large spatial scales, the universe is homogeneous and isotropic."]
Text[106] = ["Critical Mass (Critical Density)", "As applied to the universe as a whole, critical mass refers to the total required mass of matter in the universe which will allow the effects of gravity to overcome its continued outward expansion. If the universe contains more than the critical mass of matter, its gravity will eventually reverse the expansion, causing the universe to collapse back to what has become known as the Big Crunch. If, however, it contains insufficient matter, it will go on expanding forever. In the same way, critical density is that overall density of the matter in the universe which will just allow continued expansion.<BR>In other contexts, critical mass is also used to refer to the amount of fissile material needed to sustain nuclear fission."]
Text[17] = ["Dark Energy", "An invisible, hypothetical form of energy with repulsive gravity that permeates all of space, and may explain recent observations that the universe appears to be expanding at an accelerating rate. In some models of cosmology, dark energy accounts for 74% of the total mass-energy of the universe. Its exact nature remains a mystery, although Einstein’s hypothesized 'cosmological constant' is now considered a promising candidate."]
Text[18] = ["Dark Matter", "Matter that gives out no light and does not interact with the electromagnetic force, but whose presence can be inferred from gravitational effects on visible matter. It is estimated that there may be between 6 and 7 times as much dark matter as normal, bright matter in the universe, although its exact nature remains a mystery."]
Text[19] = ["Decoherence", "The process by which bodies and quantum systems lose some of their more unusual quantum properties (e.g. superposition, or the ability to appear in different places simultaneously) as they interact with their environments. When a particle decoheres, its probabilty wave collapses, any quantum superpositions disappear and it settles into its observed state under classical physics."]
Text[20] = ["Density", "The mass of an object divided by its volume, a measure of how much it is compacted or crowded together (e.g. air is low in density, iron is high). Boyle’s Law dictates that a substance increases in density as its pressure is increased or as its temperature is decreased."]
Text[21] = ["Dimensions", "Independent directions in space-time. We are familiar with the three dimensions of space (length, width and height, or east-west, north-south and up-down) and one of time (past-future), but superstring theory, for example, requires the universe to have ten dimensions."]
Text[22] = ["Electric Charge", "A property of microscopic particles, which may be either positive (e.g. protons) or negative (e.g. electrons). Particles with the same charge repel each other, and particles with opposite charges attract each other. The field of force that surrounds an electric charge is called an electric field, and a river of charged particles flowing through a conductor is called an electric current."]
Text[23] = ["Electric Field", "The field of force that surrounds an electric charge (in the same way as a magnetic field is the field of force that surrounds a magnet). Together, the electric and magnetic fields make up the electromagnetic field which underlies light and other electromagnetic waves, and changes in either field will induce changes in the other, as shown by the equations of James Clerk Maxwell."]
Text[24] = ["Electromagnetic Force (or Electromagnetism)", "The force that an electromagnetic field exerts on electrically charged particles. It is one of the four fundamental forces of physics (along with the gravitational force, the strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear force), and the one responsible for most of the forces we experience in our daily lives. The electromagnetic forces acting between the electrically charged protons and electrons inside atoms and between atoms are essentially responsible for gluing together all ordinary matter.<BR>Although hugely stronger (10<SUP>42</SUP> times) than the force of gravity, it is a less dominant force on larger scales because the attractive and repulsive interactions tend to cancel each other out. Like gravity, the electromagnetic force is subject to an inverse-square law, and its strength is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the particles. The force is mediated or operated by the exchange of photons between the particles. The ‘electrostatic force’ is one aspect of the electromagnetic force, which arises when two charged particles are static (i.e. not in motion)."]
Text[25] = ["Electromagnetic Radiation (or Electromagnetic Waves)", "A wave that travels though space at the speed of light, consisting of an electrical field that periodically grows and dies, alternating with a magnetic field that periodically dies and grows. Electromagnetic waves carry energy and momentum, which may be imparted when it interacts with matter.<BR>In order of increasing frequency, the electromagnetic spectrum includes radio waves, microwaves, terahertz radiation, infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, x-rays and gamma rays."]
Text[26] = ["Electron", "A negatively-charged sub-atomic particle. It is an indivisible, elementary particle, and is usually to be found orbiting the nucleus of an atom. Electrons in an atom (which exist in the same quantity as the number of protons in the nucleus of the particular atom, so that the overall electric charge is zero) are constrained to occupy certain discrete orbital positions or 'shells' around the nucleus.<BR>Interactions between the electrons of different atoms play an essential role in chemical bonding and phenomena such as electricity, magnetism and thermal conductivity. The discovery of electrons is credited to the British physicist J. J. Thomson in 1897."]
Text[27] = ["Element", "A substance that cannot be reduced any further by chemical means. It is a pure chemical substance composed of atoms with the same atomic number (i.e. the same number of protons in its nucleus). There are 92 naturally occurring elements on Earth, and all chemical matter consists of these elements (although a further 25 have been discovered as products of artificial nuclear reactions).<BR>The list of elements is usually shown in the form of a Periodic Table, in order of their atomic number. Elements with atomic numbers 83 or higher are inherently unstable, and undergo radioactive decay."]
Text[105] = ["Elementary Particle (or Fundamental Particle)", "A particle with no substructure (i.e. not made up of smaller particles) and which is therefore one of the basic building blocks of the universe from which all other particles are made. Quarks, electons, neutrinos, photons, muons and gluons (along with their respective anti-particles) are all elementary particles; protons and neutrons (which are made up of quarks) are not."]
Text[28] = ["Energy", "Sometimes defined as the ability to do work or to cause change, energy is notoriously difficult to define. In accordance with the Law of Conservation of Energy, energy can never be created or destroyed but it can be changed into different forms, including kinetic, potential, thermal, gravitational, sound, light, elastic and electromagnetic. The standard scientific unit of energy is the Joule."]
Text[29] = ["Entanglement", "The phenomenon in quantum theory whereby particles that interact with each other become permanently dependent on each other’s quantum states and properties, to the extent that they lose their individuality and in many ways behave as a single entity. At some level, entangled particles 'know' each other’s states and properties."]
Text[127] = ["Entropy", "A measure of the disorder of a system and of its constituent molecules. More specifically, in thermodynamics it is a measure of the unavailability of a system’s energy to do work. The Second Law of Thermodynamics embodies the idea that entropy can never decrease, but rather will tend to increase over time, approaching a maximum value as it reaches thermal equilibrium. A classic example of increasing entropy is ice melting in water until both reach a common temperature."]
Text[30] = ["Event Horizon", "A one-way boundary in space-time surrounding a black hole. Any matter or light that falls through the event horizon of a black hole can never leave, and any event inside the event horizon cannot affect an outside observer."]
Text[31] = ["Exogenesis", "The hypothesis that life on Earth was transferred from elsewhere in the universe. A related but more limited concept is that of panspermia, the idea that 'seeds' of life exist already all over the universe, and that life on Earth may have originated through these 'seeds'."]
Text[101] = ["Exotic Particle", "A kind of theoretical particle said to exist by some theories of modern physics, whose alleged properties are extremely unusual. Examples include tachyons (particles that always travels faster than the speed of light), WIMPs (weakly interacting massive particles which do not interact with electromagnetism or the strong nuclear force), axions (particles with no electric charge, very small mass and very low interaction with the strong and weak forces) and neutrinos (particles that travel close to the speed of light, lack an electric charge and are able to pass through ordinary matter almost undisturbed)."]
Text[129] = ["Expanding Universe", "A universe which is constantly growing in size and in which the constituent parts (galaxies, clusters, etc) are flying ever further away from each other.<BR>Although contrary to the static universe which had been assumed throughout most of history, an expanding universe was confirmed by Edwin Hubble’s 1929 observations of the redshifts of distant Cepheid variable stars, and is consistent with most solutions to Albert Einstein’s general relativity field equations. It also suggests that, in the distant past, the universe was much smaller and ultimately had its beginning in a Big Bang type event."]
Text[32] = ["Fundamental (or Elementary) Forces", "There are four basic forces of physics that are believed to underlie all phenomena in the universe. Listed in order of strength, they are: the strong nuclear force, the electromagnetic force, the weak nuclear force and the gravitational force (or gravity). It is thought likely that, in extremely high energy conditions such as occurred near the beginning of the Big Bang, the four fundamental forces of nature are actually unified in a single theoretical framework (known as the Grand Unification Theory).<BR>According to quantum field theory, the forces between particles are mediated by other particles, and the fundamental forces can be described by the exchange of virtual force-carrying particles: the strong nuclear force mediated by gluons; the electromagnetic force by photons; the weak nuclear force by W and Z bosons; and gravity by hypothetical gravitons."]
Text[33] = ["Galaxy", "One of the basic building block of the universe, a galaxy is a massive system of stars, stellar remnants, gas, dust and possibly a hypothetical substance known as dark matter, bound together by gravity.<BR>Galaxies may be anywhere from 1 to 100,000 light years across and are typically separated by millions of light years of intergalactic space. They are grouped into clusters, which in turn can form larger groups called superclusters and sheets or filaments.<BR>There are many different kinds of galaxy including spiral (like our own Milky Way galaxy), elliptical, ring, dwarf, lenticular and irregular. There are over a hundred billion galaxies in the observable universe."]
Text[34] = ["Gamma Ray", "A form of electromagnetic radiation produced by some kinds of radioactive decay. Gamma rays have the highest frequency and energy and the shortest wavelength in the electromagnetic spectrum, and penetrate matter more easily that either alpha particles or beta particles."]
Text[136] = ["Gamma Ray Burst", "A narrow beam of intense electromagnetic radiation released during a supernova event, as a rapidly rotating, high-mass star collapses to form a black hole. They are the brightest events known to occur in the universe, and can last from milliseconds to several minutes (typically a few seconds). The initial burst is usually followed by a longer-lived 'afterglow' emitted at longer wavelengths (X-ray, ultraviolet, optical, infrared and radio)."]
Text[35] = ["Gas", "A state of matter consisting of a collection of particles (molecules, atoms, ions, electrons, etc) without a definite shape or volume, and that are in more or less random motion. A gas tends to have relatively low density and viscosity compared to the solid and liquid states of matter, expands and contracts greatly with changes in temperature or pressure ('compressible'), and diffuses readily, spreading and homogeneously distributing itself throughout any container."]
Text[36] = ["General Theory of Relativity", "Sometimes known as the Theory of General Relativity, this was Albert Einstein’s refinement (published in 1916) of his earlier Special Theory of Relativity and Sir Isaac Newton’s much earlier Law of Universal Gravitation. The theory holds that acceleration and gravity are indistinguishable - the Principle of Equivalence - and describes gravity as a property of the geometry (more specifically a warpage) of space-time.<BR>Among other things, the theory predicts the existence of black holes, an expanding universe, time dilation, length contraction, gravitational light bending and the curvature of space-time.<BR>Although classical physics can be considered a good approximation for everyday purposes, the predictions of general relativity differ significantly from those of classical physics. They have become generally accepted in modern physics, however, and have been confirmed by all observations and experiments to date."]
Text[114] = ["Geodesic", "The shortest path between two points in curved space. It originally meant the shortest route between two points on the Earth's surface (namely a segment of a great circle) but, since its application in general relativity, it has come to mean the generalization of the notion of a straight line as applied to all curved spaces. In non-curved three-dimensional space, the geodesic is a straight line.<BR>In general relativity, a free falling body (on which only gravitational forces are acting) follows a geodesic in curved four-dimensional space-time."]
Text[131] = ["Grand Unified Theory (or Unified Field Theory)", "Also known as Grand Unification or GUT, this refers to any of several unified field theories that predict that at extremely high energies (such as occurred just after the Big Bang), the electromagnetic, weak nuclear, and strong nuclear forces are all fused into a single unified field. Thus far, physicists have only been able to merge electromagnetism and the weak nuclear force into the 'electroweak force'.<BR>Beyond Grand Unification, there is also speculation that it may be possible to merge gravity with the other three gauge symmetries into a 'theory of everything'."]
Text[37] = ["Gravity (or Gravitational Force)", "The force of attraction that exists between any two masses, whether they be stars, microscopic particles or any other bodies with mass. It is by far the weakest of the four fundamental forces (the others being the electromagnetic force, and the strong and weak nuclear forces), and yet, because it is a consistent force operating on all bodies with mass, it is instrumental in the formation of galaxies, stars, planets and black holes.<BR>It was approximately described by Sir Isaac Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation in 1687, and more accurately described by Albert Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity in 1916."]
Text[38] = ["Half-Life", "A measure of the speed of radioactive decay of unstable, radioactive atoms. It is the time taken for half of the nuclei in a radioactive sample to disintegrate or decay. Half-lives can vary from a split-second to billions of years depending on the substance."]
Text[125] = ["Hawking Radiation", "Random and featureless sub-atomic particles and thermal radiation predicted to be emitted by black holes due to quantum effects. Over long periods of time, as a black hole loses more matter through radiation than it gains through other means, it is therefore expected to dissipate, shrink and ultimately vanish."]
Text[39] = ["Horizon", "The horizon of the universe is much like the horizon on Earth: it is the furthest that can be seen from a particular location. Because light has a finite speed and the universe has a finite age, we can only see objects whose light has had time to reach us since the Big Bang, so that the observable universe can be thought of as a bubble centerd on the Earth."]
Text[40] = ["Hubble’s Law", "Formulated by Edwin Hubble in 1929, the law states that the redshift in light coming from distant galaxies is proportional to their distance from the observer, so that every galaxy appears to be rushing away from us (or from any other point in the universe) with a speed that is directly proportionate to its distance from us.<BR>It is considered the first observational basis for an expanding universe (or the metric expansion of space), and the most often cited evidence in support of the Big Bang theory, and arguably one of the most important cosmological discoveries ever made."]
Text[41] = ["Hydrostatic Equilibrium", "The state in which the force of gravitation working to crush a star is exactly balanced by the thermal pressure of its hot gas pushing outwards. It is the reason that stars in general do not implode or explode, and it also explains why the Earth's atmosphere does not collapse to a very thin layer on the ground."]
Text[42] = ["Inertia", "The natural tendency (as defined in  Sir Isaac Newton’s First Law of Motion of 1687) of objects to resist changes in their state of motion. Therefore, a body at rest tends to stay at rest and, once set in motion, a body tends to stay moving at a constant speed in a straight line (or along a geodesic in curved space) unless acted on by an outside force. An example of an inertial force is centrifugal force, which in reality is just due to a body trying to continue in a straight line while constrained to move along a curved path."]
Text[112] = ["Inertial Frame (or Inertial System)", "A reference frame in which the observers are not subject to any accelerating force. An inertial frame is a frame of reference in which a body remains at rest or moves with constant linear velocity unless acted upon by outside forces (as stipulated by Sir Isaac Newton’s First Law of Motion). Any frame of reference that moves with constant velocity relative to an inertial system is itself an inertial system."]
Text[44] = ["Interference", "The ability of two waves passing through each other to mingle, reinforcing each other where crests coincide and cancelling each other out where crests and troughs coincide, similar to the way ripples in water interfere with each other. This results, for example, in an interference pattern of light and dark stripes on a screen illuminated by light from two sources."]
Text[45] = ["Ion", "An atom or molecule that has been stripped of one or more of its orbiting electrons, thus giving it a net positive electric charge. Technically, an atom which gains an electron (thus giving it a net negative electric charge) is also a type of ion, known as an anion."]
Text[46] = ["Isotope", "A possible form of an element, distinguishable from other isotopes of the same element by its differing mass, which is caused by a different number of neutrons in the nucleus (the number of protons, which gives the atomic number of the element, must be the same). Around 75% of isotopes are stable, while some are unstable or radioactive, and will decay over time into other elements."]
Text[47] = ["Law of Conservation of Energy", "Also known as the First Law of Thermodynamics, this is the principle that energy can never be created or destroyed, only converted from one form to another (e.g. the chemical energy of gasoline can be converted into the energy of motion of a car). The total amount of energy in an isolated system (or in the universe as a whole) therefore remains constant."]
Text[48] = ["Law of Universal Gravitation", "Published by Sir Isaac Newton in 1687, and sometimes also known as the Universal Law of Gravity, this was the first formulation of the idea that all bodies with mass pull on each other across space. Newton observed that the force of gravity between two objects is proportional to the product of the two masses, and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. Although the theory has since been superseded by Albert Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, it predicts the movements of the Sun, the Moon and the planets to a high degree of accuracy and it continues to be used as an excellent approximation of the effects of gravity for everyday applications (relativity is only required when there is a need for extreme precision, or when dealing with the gravitation of very massive objects)."]
Text[120] = ["Length Contraction", "The phenomenon, predicted by Albert Einstein’s Special and General Theories of Relativity, whereby, from the relative context of one observer's frame of reference, space or length appears to decrease as the relative velocities increase."]
Text[102] = ["Life", "A difficult and contentious phenomenon to define, life is usually considered to be a characteristic of organisms that exhibit certain biological processes (such as chemical reactions or other events that results in a transformation), and that are capable of growth through metabolism and are capable of reproduction. The ability to ingest food and excrete waste are also sometimes considered requirements of life (e.g. bacteria are usually considered to be alive, whereas simpler viruses, which do not feed or excrete, are not).<BR>The two distinguishing features of living systems are sometimes considered to be complexity and organization (negative entropy). Some organisms can communicate, and many can adapt to their environment through internally generated changes, although these are not universally considered prerequisites for life."]
Text[49] = ["Light", "Technically, this refers to electromagnetic radiation of a wavelength that is visible to the human eye, although in the broader field of physics, it is sometimes used to refer to electromagnetic radiation of all wavelengths, whether visible or not. It exhibits 'wave-particle duality' in that it can behave as both waves and particles (photons) Light travels at a constant speed of about 300,000 kilometers per second in a vacuum."]
Text[50] = ["Light Year", "A convenient unit for measuring the large distances in the universe. It is the distance that light travels in one year which, given that light travels at 300,000 kilometers per second, works out to about 9,460,000,000,000 kilometers (9.46 trillion kilometers)."]
Text[51] = ["Magnetic Field", "The field of force that surrounds a magnet (in the same way as an electric field is the field of force that surrounds an electric charge). Together, the magnetic and electric fields make up the electromagnetic field which underlies light and other electromagnetic waves, and changes in either field will induce changes in the other, as indicated by James Clerk Maxwell’s Equations of Electromagnetism."]
Text[130] = ["Magnetic Monopole", "A hypothetical particle that is a magnet with only one pole, and which therefore has a net magnetic charge. Although the existence of monopoles is indicated by both classical theory and quantum theory (and predicted by recent string theories and grand unified theories), there is still no observational evidence for their physical existence."]
Text[52] = ["Mass", "A measure of the amount of matter in a body. It can also be seen as a measure of a body’s inertia or resistence to change in motion, or the degree of acceleration a body acquires when subject to a force (bodies with greater mass are accelerated less by the same force and have greater inertia). Mass is often confused with weight, which is the strength of the gravitational pull on the object (and therefore how heavy it is in a particular gravitational situation), although, in everyday situations, the weight of an object is proportional to its mass."]
Text[110] = ["Mass-Energy Equivalence", "The concept that any mass has an associated energy, and that, conversly, any energy has an associated mass. In Einstein’s Special Theory of Relativity, this relationship is expressed in the famous mass-energy equivalence formula, <I>E = mc<SUP>2</SUP></I>, where <I>E</I> = total energy, <I>m</I> = mass and <I>c</I> = the speed of light in a vacuum. Given that <I>c</I> is a very large number, it becomes apparent that mass is in fact a very concentrated form of energy."]
Text[107] = ["Matter", "Anything that has both mass and volume (i.e. takes up space). Matter is what atoms and molecules are made of, and it exists in four states or phases: solid, liquid, gas and plasma (although other phases, such as Bose-Einstein condensates, also exist)."]
Text[53] = ["Molecule", "A collection of atoms glued together by electromagnetic forces. A more formal definition might be: a sufficiently stable electrically neutral group of at least two atoms, in a definite arrangement, held together by very strong chemical bonds. A molecule may consist of atoms of the same chemical element (e.g. oxygen: O<SUB>2</SUB>) or of different elements (e.g. water: H<SUB>2</SUB>O). Organic molecules are those which include carbon, and the others are called inorganic."]
Text[54] = ["Momentum", "A measure of how much effort is required to stop a body, defined as the body’s mass multiplied by its velocity. Thus, a large heavy body (e.g. a train) going relatively slowly may have more momentum than a smaller body going very fast (e.g. a racing car). The Law of Conservation of Momentum rules that the total momentum of an isolated system (one in which no net external force acts on the system) does not change."]
Text[55] = ["Multiverse (Parallel Universes)", "A hypothetical set of multiple possible universes (including our own) which exist in parallel with each other. Our universe would then be just one of an enormous number of separate and distinct universes, the vast majority of which would be dead and uninteresting, not having a set of physical laws which would allow the emergence of stars, planets and life."]
Text[57] = ["Neutrino", "A sub-atomic elementary particle with no electrical charge and very small mass that travels very close to the speed of light. They are created as a result of certain types of radioactive decay or nuclear reaction, such as the decay of a free neutron (i.e. one outside of a nucleus) into a proton and electron.<BR>Being electrically neutral and unaffected by the strong nuclear force or the electromagnetic force, neutrinos are able to pass through ordinary matter almost undisturbed and are therefore extremely difficult to detect, although when created in huge numbers they are capable of blowing a star apart in a supernova."]
Text[58] = ["Neutron", "One of the two main building blocks (along with the proton) of the nucleus at the center of an atom. Neutrons have essentially the same mass as a proton (very slightly larger) but no electric charge, and are made up of one 'up' quark and two 'down' quarks.
